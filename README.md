Random Data
===========

For various purposes you might need random data to test your application. Writing a random generator is relative easy. But writing the same over and over can be tiresome. Also there is a problem if you have alternative locales you have to test against, that you reinvent the wheel yet again.

For this I created this small collection of classes, hoping others will find them as useful as they were for me. More country specific settings and locales are always very welcome.
